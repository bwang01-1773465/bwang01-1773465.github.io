<h1>Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.[24] Google received money from three other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professor David Cheriton, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[25]
After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[25] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[26] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital.[24]
Early in 1999, Brin and Page decided they wanted to sell Google to Excite. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer. Vinod Khosla, one of Excite's venture capitalists, talked the duo down to $750,000, but Bell still rejected it.[27] Source: wikipedia</h1>
